This project sets up a systemd service that **randomizes your MAC address at system boot** for all type of network interfaces like (`enp7s0` and `wlp13s0`). It uses [`macchanger`](https://github.com/alobbs/macchanger) and works on **Arch Linux** or any `systemd` linux-based distro.

## 🛡️ Why Use It?
- Improve privacy by changing your MAC on every boot and with interval of every 5 minutes.
- Spoof MAC address to avoid tracking on public networks.
- Lightweight and portable on any linux based devices and runs automatically.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install macchanger

```bash
### For manual installation.  
sudo pacman -S macchanger 

### 2. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/macchanger-daemon.git
cd macchanger-daemon

### 3. Copy files to appropriate locations
sudo cp change-mac.sh /usr/local/bin/change-mac.sh
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/change-mac.sh
sudo cp macchanger.service /etc/systemd/system/macchanger.service

### 4. Enable the service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable macchanger.service
sudo systemctl start macchanger.service
```

## 🔁 Want to randomize MAC every 30 minutes?
- Create a systemd timer now available for linux based distros 

## ✨ Contributions Welcome

- Support for more interfaces?

- AUR package?

- Cross-platform support?

- Feel free to fork and send PRs!

🐍 Python (via pip)

> 📌 Coming Soon: Once published to PyPI

Install with:

pip install macchanger-daemon

Then run:

macchanger-daemon

This will run the same MAC randomization logic and can be daemonized with cron or systemd timer.
🔁 Want to randomize every 30 minutes?

Create a systemd timer unit like macchanger.timer and adjust the interval. See docs/timer-example.md for reference (coming soon).
